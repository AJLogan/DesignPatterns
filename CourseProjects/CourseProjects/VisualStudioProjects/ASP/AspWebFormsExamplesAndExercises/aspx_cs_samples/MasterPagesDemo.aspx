        <i>Stage Direction: <br />
            Enter LEONATO, HERO, and BEATRICE, with a Messenger</i>
    </p>
    <h4>LEONATO</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">comes this night to Messina.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>Messenger</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">when I left him.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>LEONATO</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>Messenger</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">But few of any sort, and none of name.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>LEONATO</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>Messenger</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">bettered expectation than you must expect of me to<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">tell you how.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>LEONATO</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">glad of it.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>Messenger</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">I have already delivered him letters, and there<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">not show itself modest enough without a badge of<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">bitterness.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>LEONATO</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Did he break out into tears?<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>Messenger</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">In great measure.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>LEONATO</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">truer than those that are so washed. How much<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BEATRICE</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">wars or no?<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>Messenger</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">I know none of that name, lady: there was none such<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">in the army of any sort.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>LEONATO</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">What is he that you ask for, niece?<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>HERO</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>Messenger</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">O, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BEATRICE</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, reading<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>LEONATO</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much;<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>Messenger</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BEATRICE</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">excellent stomach.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>Messenger</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">And a good soldier too, lady.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BEATRICE</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>Messenger</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">honourable virtues.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BEATRICE</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>LEONATO</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">between them.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BEATRICE</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">now is the whole man governed with one: so that if<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">bear it for a difference between himself and his<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>Messenger</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Is't possible?<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BEATRICE</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">next block.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>Messenger</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BEATRICE</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">you, who is his companion? Is there no young<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>Messenger</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BEATRICE</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">thousand pound ere a' be cured.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>Messenger</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">I will hold friends with you, lady.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BEATRICE</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Do, good friend.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>LEONATO</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">You will never run mad, niece.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BEATRICE</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">No, not till a hot January.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>Messenger</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Don Pedro is approached.<br/>
        </span>

        <i>Stage Direction: Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, <br />
                CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and BALTHASAR</i>
    </p>
    <h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">cost, and you encounter it.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>LEONATO</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">and happiness takes his leave.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">is your daughter.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>LEONATO</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Her mother hath many times told me so.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BENEDICK</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>LEONATO</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">herself. Be happy, lady; for you are like an<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">honourable father.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BENEDICK</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">like him as she is.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BEATRICE</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">Benedick: nobody marks you.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BENEDICK</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BEATRICE</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Is it possible disdain should die while she hath<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">in her presence.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BENEDICK</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">heart; for, truly, I love none.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BEATRICE</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">A dear happiness to women: they would else have<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">swear he loves me.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BENEDICK</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">scratched face.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BEATRICE</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">a face as yours were.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BENEDICK</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BEATRICE</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BENEDICK</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">name; I have done.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BEATRICE</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">the least a month; and he heartily prays some<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">hypocrite, but prays from his heart.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>LEONATO</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.<br/>

        <span class="line">Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">the prince your brother, I owe you all duty.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>DON JOHN</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">you.<br/>

        <span class="line">Please it your grace lead on?<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>DON PEDRO</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Stage Direction: Exeunt all except BENEDICK and CLAUDIO</i>
    </p>
    <h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BENEDICK</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">I noted her not; but I looked on her.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Is she not a modest young lady?<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BENEDICK</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>CLAUDIO</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BENEDICK</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">praise, too brown for a fair praise and too little<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">for a great praise: only this commendation I can<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">afford her, that were she other than she is, she<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">were unhandsome; and being no other but as she is, I<br/>
        </span>

        <i>Stage Direction: Enter DON JOHN and CONRADE</i>
    </p>
    <h4>CONRADE</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">What the good-year, my lord! why are you thus out<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">of measure sad?<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>DON JOHN</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">There is no measure in the occasion that breeds;<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">therefore the sadness is without limit.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>CONRADE</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">You should hear reason.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>DON JOHN</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it?<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>CONRADE</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">If not a present remedy, at least a patient<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">sufferance.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>DON JOHN</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayest thou art,<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">what I am: I must be sad when I have cause and smile<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">at no man's jests, eat when I have stomach and wait<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">for no man's leisure, sleep when I am drowsy and<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">tend on no man's business, laugh when I am merry and<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">claw no man in his humour.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>CONRADE</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Yea, but you must not make the full show of this<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">till you may do it without controlment. You have of<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">late stood out against your brother, and he hath<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">ta'en you newly into his grace; where it is<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">impossible you should take true root but by the<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">that you frame the season for your own harvest.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>DON JOHN</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">his grace, and it better fits my blood to be<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">my liking: in the meantime let me be that I am and<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">seek not to alter me.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>CONRADE</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Can you make no use of your discontent?<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>DON JOHN</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">I make all use of it, for I use it only.<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">Who comes here?<br/>
        </span>
        <p>
            <i>Stage Direction: Enter BORACHIO</i>
        </p>
        <span class="line">What news, Borachio?<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BORACHIO</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">I came yonder from a great supper: the prince your<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">brother is royally entertained by Leonato: and I<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>DON JOHN</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Will it serve for any model to build mischief on?<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">What is he for a fool that betroths himself to<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">unquietness?<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BORACHIO</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Marry, it is your brother's right hand.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>DON JOHN</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Who? the most exquisite Claudio?<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BORACHIO</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Even he.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>DON JOHN</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">A proper squire! And who, and who? which way looks<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">he?<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BORACHIO</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>DON JOHN</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BORACHIO</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">musty room, comes me the prince and Claudio, hand<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">in hand in sad conference: I whipt me behind the<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">arras; and there heard it agreed upon that the<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">prince should woo Hero for himself, and having<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">obtained her, give her to Count Claudio.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>DON JOHN</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Come, come, let us thither: this may prove food to<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">glory of my overthrow: if I can cross him any way, I<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me?<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>CONRADE</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">To the death, my lord.<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>DON JOHN</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">Let us to the great supper: their cheer is the<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">greater that I am subdued. Would the cook were of<br/>
        </span>
        <span class="line">my mind! Shall we go prove what's to be done?<br/>
        </span>
    </p>
    <h4>BORACHIO</h4>
    <p>
        <span class="line">We'll wait upon your lordship.<br/>
